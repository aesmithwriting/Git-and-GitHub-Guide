# Guide to Git and GitHub for Writers



## Introduction

Earlier this year, Custom Programming Solutions hired a remote freelance writer on a semi-regular basis for some of our web and marketing projects. Though the team started out using Google Docs to collaborate on website content, bios and more, we soon found that having multiple authors work closely together on more than one project simultaneously quickly grew into an unorganized jumble of comments, suggested changes, and updates. We realized pretty quickly that we'd need to build a more structured workflow if we were going to publish high-quality content efficiently. 

Enter GitHub. The repository hosting service for Git is much-loved by developers for its robust version control, issues management and change tracking capabilities. It turns out, writers are on a continual quest for a tool that offers these features and allows them to work on a truly collaborative basis with their clients.
