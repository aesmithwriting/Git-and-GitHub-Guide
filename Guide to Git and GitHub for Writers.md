# Guide to Git and GitHub for Writers



## Introduction

Earlier this year, my simmering rage at conventional word processors finally boiled to the surface, driving me to take the drastic action I'd been putting off for years: Learn to write and publish content using Git and GitHub (*insert gasp here*.) 

Okay, maybe that's being a *bit* dramatic (hey, I'm a writer - I'm using creative license here). It wasn't exactly rage. More like an underlying frustration I couldn't quite put my finger on. After all, what was different about this project versus the hundreds I've worked on before, that made working with Word (or Google Docs, my old go-to) untenable? 

Actually, a few things:

- I was working remotely on a long-term project for a startup software development client with high technical expertise located on the other side of the world. 
- We needed a central, open-source, reliable platform that everyone knew how to access and use.
- We had several collaborators, each with valuable insights and perspectives to offer on the content I created. 
- With so many small pieces of content, we needed an easy way to track progress, revisions and dialogue on each one. 

Enter GitHub. After a couple of months plugging away on Google Docs (a tool I'd sworn by previously and still use for collaborating with less technically savvy clients on short-term projects), we all began to discover its limitations when it came to formalizing an efficient content production and approval process. My client (Custom Programming Solutions) generously offered to teach me how to use Git and GitHub so we could collaborate more productively long-term. *Bonus: I get to share what I learned with you!* 

 This is a guide for writers, by a writer/content marketer who's been where you are: frustrated with the constraints and headaches current writing software and workflows foist on us, and wondering if there's anything better - an open source, distraction-free, secure platform that supports hassle-free collaboration between you and your clients. 

I'll cover the following:
