# Guide to Git and GitHub for Writers



## Introduction

Earlier this year, my simmering rage at conventional word processors finally boiled to the surface, driving me to take the drastic action I'd been putting off for years: Learn to write and publish content using Git and GitHub (*insert gasp here*.) 

Okay, maybe that's being a *bit* dramatic (hey, I'm a writer - I'm using creative license here). It wasn't exactly rage. More like an underlying frustration I couldn't quite put my finger on. After all, what was different about this project versus the hundreds I've worked on before, that made working with Word (or Google Docs, my old go-to) untenable? 

Actually, a few things:

- I was working remotely on a long-term project for a startup software development client with high technical expertise located on the other side of the world. 
- We needed a central, open-source, reliable platform that everyone knew how to access and use.
- We had several collaborators, each with valuable insights and perspectives to offer on the content I created. 
- With so many small pieces of content, we needed an easy way to track progress, revisions and dialogue on each one. 

Enter GitHub. After a couple of months plugging away on Google Docs (a tool I'd sworn by previously and still use for collaborating with less technically savvy clients on short-term projects), we all began to discover its limitations when it came to formalizing an efficient content production and approval process. My client (Custom Programming Solutions) generously offered to teach me how to use Git and GitHub so we could collaborate more productively long-term. *Bonus: I get to share what I learned with you!* 

 This is a guide for writers, by a writer/content marketer who's been where you are: frustrated with the constraints and headaches current writing software and workflows foist on us, and wondering if there's anything better - an open source, distraction-free, secure platform that supports hassle-free collaboration between you and your clients. 

I'll cover the following:

### What are Git and GitHub?

### Git

Git is a general purpose distributed revision control system. Essentially, it's version control software (VCS) designed to let you manage your workflow and keep track of versions of documents. 

 VCS systems calculate differences, or deltas, between documents. Comparing differences between versions means some exciting options appear at your fingertips, including:

- Reports on differences between versions

- Easily merging changes to documents (which can be confusing with Word or other word processors) 

- Referencing change sets directly (so you and your collaborators each understand exactly which changes are being discussed)

- Creating patches (*explanation here*)



  For Git to be able to calculate differences between files, the files must be stored in a document that the software can "read" so it can detect what's changed. A plain text file (e.g.: a Markdown document) is perfect for this. Any changes to the document will be seen in the lines of the file that are responsible for it. Contrast this to other file types like Word .doc files, where a change to one line is hard to locate in the file, or images, where changing the file won't lead to a nice textual summary of what's changed.

### Why should writers use GitHub?

---

 Though Git is a repository hosting service much-loved by developers for its robust version control, issues management and change tracking capabilities. It turns out, writers are on a continual quest for a tool that offers these features and allows them to work on a truly collaborative basis with their clients.

*Explanation*



### Benefits of distributed vs. centralized systems

Git is a decentralized version control system. Here's why that's important: 

- **Each repository is essentially a backup.**
  My client (who's used Git for several years) says he has yet to lose a large amount of data on any project using Git. Even if one machine goes down, you can still access your data from other machines. The decentralized system is a nice backup feature in disguise. If you didn't have this, you'd need to consider backups and disaster recovery strategies. Not having to be so worried about this means you reduce the mental burden on you and your team, and reduce the risk of a devastating loss of data and hours. 

- **You'll have a stable platform to collaborate with clients and partners.**

  Because the system is decentralized, it's designed to handle multiple people can work on the same document at the same time. While some centralized systems (such as Joomla, *other examples*)





### What you need to get started

Steps
 Use a collaborative writing project as an example - get blocked on this - message Janis on slack. want live on site as quickly as possible. ask Janis for example usage of git 

1. Create a repository 
2. Create a branch
3. Commit changes
4. The diff viewer
5. Collaborate (open a pull request)
6. Merge Pull Request (Review and publish phase)
